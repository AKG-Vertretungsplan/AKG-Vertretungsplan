Possible improvements for a future release:
- shortcut to unformatted plan (already possible with lesson plan)
- Option to replace entries of lessonPlan with matching substitutions
- on list item click: focus animation colors? →  fix no click animation for non transparent backgrounds
- List for teacher abbreviations → also show full names of teachers entered there (in addition to lesson plan's teachers)
- add action bar with up navigation to nested PreferenceScreens
- instead of checking if already downloading before starting DownloadService, do in DownloadService itself by extending Service instead of IntentService
- add reset colors settings setting
- widget background button color settings
- add save current vplan feature?
